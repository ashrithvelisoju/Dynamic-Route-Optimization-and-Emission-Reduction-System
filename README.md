## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate are the emission calculations?**
A: Our calculations are based on EPA standards and real-world vehicle data, with typical accuracy within 10-15% of actual emissions.

**Q: Can this work without internet connectivity?**
A: Basic routing works offline with cached map data, but real-time optimization requires internet connectivity.

**Q: What mapping services are supported?**
A: We support OpenStreetMap (default), Google Maps, and Mapbox. Configuration options are available in settings.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I add support for electric vehicles?**
A: Electric vehicle profiles can be added through the admin interface or API. Include battery capacity, charging efficiency, and local electricity grid carbon intensity.

**Q: Can I integrate this with existing fleet management systems?**
A: Yes, we provide REST APIs and webhook support for integration with external systems. See the API documentation for details.

**Q: How do I contribute custom optimization algorithms?**
A: Implement the `OptimizationStrategy` interface and submit a pull request. See the contribution guidelines below.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Routes are not updating in real-time**
A: Check Redis connection and ensure traffic API keys are valid. Enable debug logging for detailed diagnostics.

**Q: High memory usage during route calculation**
A: Adjust the `MAX_WAYPOINTS` setting or implement route segmentation for very long routes.
